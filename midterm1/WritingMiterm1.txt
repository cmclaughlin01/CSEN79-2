Question 1:
A constructor is a member function of a class that is automatically called
when an object of that class is created. They are used to initialize any
varibles and allocate space. Where as a copy constructor is a type of 
constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
The copy constructor intakes a reference to the original object.

class SomeClass {
    public:
        int someNum;
    
    //constructor
    SomeClass(){
        someNum = 0;
    }

    //copy constructor
    SomeClass(SomeClass& other){
        someNum = other.someNum
    }
}

Question 2
When the compiler uses its default constructor it initializes the object and 
all its member variables. However, all of the values its initialized with
contain garbage values. The default copy constructor on the other hand 
creates a shallow copies of the variables.
