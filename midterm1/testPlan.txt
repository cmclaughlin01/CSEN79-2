#Test Plan for midterm 1
For testing I used a sperated program that compared the output
of the ratnum program against a file of expected output. The ratnum
program takes in the test.txt that contains the name of the 
operation wanted to be done then four numbers which are inputed as
the numerators and demonators. Once the operation is run it places 
the same format as well as the output into a txt file named
output.txt. This is fed into the examine.cxx along with the expected
outputs to check if the operation were run correctly

To run this program:
$ make
$ ./ratnumTest test.txt
$ ./examine output.txt expectedOutcome.txt

once run examine.cxx prints every test, what its doing and if the 
test was passed. After all tests it prints out the amount of test 
passed and how many of each operation was run in the test.
